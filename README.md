# Nepomuk font family

This font family is inspired by the type commonly found in music plate engraving from the late 19th to the mid 20th-century.

Based on characters designed by Florian Kretlow, the family has been expanded with Bold and Bold Italic weights. Kerning and tracking has been improved, and a greater range of characters added. Glyphs have been improved throughout. Additions includes more diacritics and non-Roman characters (for all your Czech and Icelandic composers), and punctuation, including non-breaking hyphens. There are also extra characters of use in music, such as Unicode music accidentals, and versicle and response symbols.

The accidentals can be accessed using the ligatures $b, $n, and $s, or directly using their Unicode values U+266D - U+266F).

v2.01: More improvements to kerning; Small Caps have been added to Regular and Bold styles.  
v2.02: More kerning revisions! Also Unicode Roman Numerals to Regular and Italic styles.

A small range of sample pages, such as this one below, can be found in the images folder.
