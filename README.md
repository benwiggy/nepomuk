# Nepomuk font family

This font family is inspired by the 'punch' text commonly found in music plate engraving in the 20th-century. 

Based on characters designed by Florian Ktretlow, the family has been expanded with Bold and Bold Italic weights. Kerning and tracking has been improved, and a greater range of characters added. This includes diacritics and non-Roman characters (for all your Czech and Icelandic composers), punctuation including non-breaking hyphens, and Unicode musical accidentals.

A small range of sample pages, showing the text fonts on a variety of example title pages of music, can be found in the images folder.
