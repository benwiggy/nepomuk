These Unified Font Object files should be openable by any font editor, such as Font Forge, FontLab, Glyphs, etc; to allow further revisions and forks to be made .

The Greek.Cyrillic.IPA file is a temporary working file, for the addition of Greek, Cyrillic and IPA glyphs to the font. It is currently a 'work in progress'. This is the focus of future development for the fonts.
